# pandas-challenge-1
## Background 
This module challenge focused on data analysis with Python's Pandas library. As a crucial component in various fields, such as data science, machine learning, and business intelligence, practical data analysis involves examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting useful information from large datasets. This assignment provides a hands-on opportunity to develop these skills.

In this challenge, I explored and analyzed a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, to address real-world business questions like identifying the top customers, popular product categories, calculating profits, and more. 
## Setup
You can run the Jupiter notebook file *wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb* It uses the *client_dataset.csv* file located in the Resources folder, as its source data to perform my analysis. 
>I used a lambda function to change the currency format to millions for all columns with a currency
## Summary
After analysis, the top five customers from most profitable to least were:

|Client_ID |First Name| Last Name | Profits (Millions)| 
|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
|24741|Kendra|Garrett|$36.105796
|66037|Angela|Everett|$3.125980	
|38378|Alexandra|Young|$2.954605
|46820|Bryan|Myers|$2.588469		
|33615|Jessica|Reyes|$2.032814
